	<h1>my speech</h1>
	<p>Good afternoon comrades, I really appreciate for your time to sit back and listen to my speech of few words.</p>
	<p>It has been a great chivalry to be with you all these years. In all the times we have been together, I have learnt a lot from you and a lot more done in this difficult time. But once we know that life is difficult-once we truly apprehend and on fang it then life is no longer cumbersome</p>
	<p>In life you will have difficulties in getting anything you want. It is very laborious to get anything in life without some degree of effort. Only if you win a lottery will you have everything without effort, but even then you will have to buy the ticket so it is not free at all.</p>
	<p>Life is cumbersome, your boss will not always be the nicest person in the world, your job will have challenges that you did not foresee, your workmates will sometimes be a pain, you will not always get the salary and recognition that you want and deserve at work, the pupils you teach may not be the nicest people in the world.</p>
	<p>As cliche said; if life lands you lemons make lemonade.  We have been in tough times together, I can not forget the sad time when we had lost our two beloved friends (Chibeka and Charity) but in every set up you have showed me the best, even in happy moments I remember the time we went to Kafue miyanganas together, the closing parties we had and some mini parties we had at school, to me it’s been a great family together</p>
	<p>I try to give myself a goal every day. Understand that to execute these goals you must apply discipline and consistency. You have to work at it every day. You have to plan every day. Maybe you have heard the saying which says, we do not plan to fail, we fail to plan. Hard work works.</p>
	<p>Working really hard is what successful people do. Remember just because you are doing alotmore doesn’t mean you are getting a lot more done. Don’t flummox movement with progress, continue to strive continue to have goals continue to progress, and anything you want good you can have. Claim it work hard to get it. When you get it reach back, pull someone else up. Each one teaches one, don’t just aspire to make a living but aspire to make a difference.</p>
	<p>Missing you all crown academy teachers, how I wish to work together with you again.</p>
